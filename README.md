# Overview

Structure Planner is a lightweight Excel-based project quantification tool that provides powerful, simple, and structured project planning with up to 12 workstreams. It is designed for small, agile teams (two-pizza teams) to facilitate early project phase ideation, cost estimation, and task visualization. The tool offers the flexibility to define work periods in days, weeks, quarters, or years and does not rely on macros or external plugins, ensuring it works seamlessly across platforms, including Excel for web and mobile, making it ideal for small teams that lack a commonly accessible Enterprise Project Managament (EPM) system.

#### Key Features:
- 4-tier project planner for structured project planning.
- Support for up to 12 workstreams.
- Configurable work periods (days, weeks, quarters, years).
- Designed for Excel for web compatibility and mobile-friendly.
- Delivered in a VB- and PowerQuery-free workbook with protected sheets for error-free authoring (without passwords).

# Usage

### 1. Describing Tasks
To describe and organize tasks within Structure Planner:
- Use the **workstream tabs** (one for each workstream) to enter values in the following columns:
  - **Task**: Name or description of the task.
  - **Subtask**: Break down the task further into specific actions.
  - **Resource**: Identify resources associated with the task or subtask.
  - **Base Quantity**: Assign the quantity of each resource needed for the task or subtask.
- For workstream management, navigate to the **enum page** to add or remove workstreams.
- Each workstream is automatically **summarized by task**, showing the aggregate effect of your input.

### 2. Managing Workstreams
Structure Planner supports up to **12 workstreams**. To add a new workstream:
1. **Copy an existing sheet**: Duplicate one of the existing workstream sheets.
2. **Rename the new workstream**: Change the sheet name by editing **Cell $B$2** with your chosen name.
3. **Register the new workstream**: Go to the **enum worksheet** and add the new worksheet name to the **workstream table**.

### 3. Cost Modeling (Optional)
Structure Planner provides **cost modeling** based on resource definitions.
- Each **resource** described in the workstream tabs must be defined in the **Resource Tab** for cost calculations.
- **Cost modeling is optional**: You can skip resource definitions if you donâ€™t need cost calculations.
- The default resource list is populated using **fully loaded United States OTE (On-Target Earnings)** for typical job roles (pre-populated via a ChatGPT query).

### 4. Phasing Resources (Optional)
Structure Planner allows you to phase resources over time, applying specific multipliers to resource values for each phase.

- **Phase-specific multipliers**: You can apply a phase-specific headwind or tailwind to adjust the **base declared value** of a resource for each phase. This does **not** affect previous phases.
- **Non-calculated values**: If you manually adjust the resource values in a phase, they will no longer be linked to the base or multiplier, and the cells will be flagged **blue** to indicate they are non-calculated.
- **Per-workstream setup**: Phasing is managed on a **per-workstream basis**.



# FAQ

### 1. **What is Structure Planner?**
Structure Planner is a simple yet powerful, 4-tier project planning tool designed for agile, small teams (two-pizza teams). It helps with early project phase ideation, cost sizing, and task visualization, supporting up to 12 workstreams in an Excel-based format. It is designed to handle different time periods and works without macros (VB- and PowerQuery-free).

---

### 2. **What type of projects is Structure Planner suitable for?**
Structure Planner is ideal for:
- Early-stage project ideation and planning
- Quick cost estimation and iteration during contract bidding phases
- Projects that need to identify major milestones ("big rocks") early on
- Running "what-if" analyses, business case development, and parallel analysis (e.g., red/blue teams)
- Cross-organizational collaboration where different teams may use diverse data structures
- Auditing and modeling operational project structures for implementation in Enterprise Project Management (EPM) software

---

### 3. **How many workstreams can I manage with Structure Planner?**
Structure Planner supports up to **12 workstreams**, making it suitable for managing multiple task flows within a project.

---

### 4. **Can I customize the length of the project timespan and work periods?**
Yes, Structure Planner can handle an arbitrary number of work periods and timespans. It can be configured to work with different time periods such as **days, weeks, quarters, or years**.

---

### 5. **Is Structure Planner compatible with Excel for web and mobile devices?**
Yes, Structure Planner is designed to be **Excel for web compatible** and mobile-friendly, making it accessible across various devices and platforms without any dependencies on VBA or PowerQuery.

---

### 6. **What kind of data entry is required?**
Structure Planner requires a **simple, 5-parameter data entry** for defining resources. You can add tasks, subtasks, and resources freely and receive **real-time visual feedback** as you populate data.

---

### 7. **Does Structure Planner include financial estimates and cost modeling?**
Yes, Structure Planner provides **cost estimates by resource type** and allows you to flag expenses as either **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** or **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**. It summarizes financials and key measures across all workstreams.

---

### 8. **What are some key features delivered by Structure Planner?**
- Simple data entry for tasks and resources
- Automatic aggregation and summarization of key metrics across workstreams
- Support for variable project phases and time-linked tasks
- Filterable workstream views and real-time feedback on data entry
- Flexible task placement anywhere within the worksheet

---

### 9. **What are the current limitations of Structure Planner?**
- **No sorting support** for rows within the workstream view.
- **Resource limits**: Currently, it supports up to 100 subtasks/resources per workstream for a total of 1,200 resources.
  
---

### 10. **What future features are planned for Structure Planner?**
- Forecast measures like revenue and margin
- Visuals comparing **revenue/margin against project expenditure**
- Milestone creation and tracking within phases
- Roadmap charts for project phases and milestones
- Mermaid markup support for project hierarchy visualization
